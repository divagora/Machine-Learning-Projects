## Gaussian Process Regression ##

### Summary ###

In this project, we investigate a probabilistic model that is often used within the atmospheric and environmental sciences, namely, Gaussian process regression. We apply this model to the Mauna Loa dataset to construct a predictive model for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over a 20 year period.
