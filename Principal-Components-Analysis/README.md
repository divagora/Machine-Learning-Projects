## Principal Components Analysis ##

### Summary ###

This project investigates the use of dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis (PCA) within a classification algorithm for face recognition. We consider a data set consisting of training and test images of faces, each of which is 112 pixels tall and 92 pixels wide. By computing a PCA basis we construct a lower dimensional representation of these images, which we then use within a nearest neighbour classifier.
