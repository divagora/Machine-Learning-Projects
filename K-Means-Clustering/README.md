## K-Means Clustering ##

### Summary ###

A major use of machine learning in the biological sciences is for automatic image processing, for example distinguishing cells (and their components, such as the nuclei) from background material. In this project, we use the Gaussian mixture model and K-means algorithm to (a) obtain an automatic segmentation of the image, and (b) automatically count the number of cells in the image.
