# Machine Learning Portfolio #

This repository contains a collection of various machine learning projects, completed alongside my PhD.


## Contents ##

### Regression ###

* [Gaussian Process Regression](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Gaussian-Process-Regression). This project considers the use of a Gaussian process to model and predict monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. 


### Clustering ###

* [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/K-Means-Clustering). This project explores the use of a Gaussian mixture model and the k-means algorithm to obtain an automatic segmentation of an image, and to automatically count the number of cells in the image.  


### Dimensionality Reduction ###

* [Principal Components Analysis](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Principal-Components-Analysis). This project investigates the use of dimensionality reduction via principal components analysis in the context of a classification algorithm for face recognition.


### Deep Learning ###

* [Artificial Neural Networks](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Artificial-Neural-Networks). This project investigates the use of an artificial neural network to predict stock market prices.
