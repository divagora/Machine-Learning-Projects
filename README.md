# Machine Learning Portfolio #

This repository contains a collection of various machine learning projects completed over the last two years.


## Contents ##

### Regression ###

* [Gaussian Process Regression](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Gaussian-Process-Regression). This project considers the use of a Gaussian process to model and predict monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. 


### Clustering ###

* [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/K-Means-Clustering). This project explores the use of a Gaussian mixture model and the k-means algorithm to obtain an automatic segmentation of an image, and to automatically count the number of cells in the image.  


### Dimensionality Reduction ###

* [Principal Components Analysis](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Principal-Components-Analysis). This project investigates the use of dimensionality reduction via principal components analysis in the context of a classification algorithm for face recognition.


### Deep Learning ###

* [Reucrrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Recurrent-Neural-Networks). This project investigates the use of recurrent neural networks to predict stock market prices.
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Convolutional-Neural-Networks). This project explores the use of a convolutional neural network to classify images. 
* [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Generative-Adversarial-Networks). This project considers the use of a generatie adversarial network (GAN) to generate new images of faces. 


### Natural Language Processing ###

* [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/louissharrock/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Convolutional-Neural-Networks). This project applies three models - naive Bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVMs) - to perform sentiment analysis.
